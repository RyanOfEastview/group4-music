# GROUP4 - Live Music Finder	

We are Group4, including Hiu Sum Jaime Yue, Spencer Cole, Ryan McCarthy.		
This is GROUP4 - Live Music Finder, a music web application that allows
 user to search by inputting an artist name to get their upcoming events and music snippets of the artist through 
the embedded Spotify.    	

In GROUP4 - Live Music Finder, there are 2 pages, the index page and dates page. 
On the index page, there is a input field that you can put in an artist name and click on the Find show button.          
After clicking on the Find shows button, you will be transferred to the dates page. 
It shows the upcoming events as clickable links so you can purchase a ticket through Ticketmaster.com. 
Youtube link of the artist will be provided. Next to the tour dates, a Spotify section will shown up to provide 
a suggested collection of music snippets by the artist.
